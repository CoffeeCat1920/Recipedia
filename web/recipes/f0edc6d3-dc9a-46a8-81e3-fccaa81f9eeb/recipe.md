# 🍅 Homemade Tomato Soup Recipe

A warm and comforting tomato soup, perfect for chilly days! 🍵

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 4 large tomatoes, chopped (or 1 can of whole tomatoes, 400g)  
- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)  
- 1 tsp salt  
- ½ tsp black pepper  
- ½ tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)  
- ½ tsp dried basil (or fresh basil for garnish)  
- ¼ cup heavy cream or milk (optional, for creaminess)  

## Instructions

1. **Sauté the aromatics**  
   Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.  

2. **Cook the tomatoes**  
   Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) to the pot. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they soften and break down.  

3. **Blend the soup**  
   Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, let it cool slightly and blend in a regular blender, then return to the pot.  

4. **Season and simmer**  
   Add vegetable broth, salt, pepper, sugar, and basil. Stir well and let the soup simmer for 10-15 minutes.  

5. **Add cream (optional)**  
   If you want a creamy texture, stir in the heavy cream or milk. Let it heat through but avoid boiling.  

6. **Serve and enjoy**  
   Ladle into bowls, garnish with fresh basil or croutons, and enjoy your homemade tomato soup! 🍲  

## Notes

- For extra flavor, roast the tomatoes in the oven before adding them to the pot.  
- You can add red chili flakes for a spicy kick.  
- Serve with grilled cheese for the ultimate comfort meal!  

Enjoy your delicious tomato soup! 🍅✨
