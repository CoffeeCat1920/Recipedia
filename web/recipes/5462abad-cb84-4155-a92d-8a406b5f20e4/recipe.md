# Homemade Banana Bread

## Description
A moist and flavorful banana bread recipe that's perfect for using up overripe bananas. This simple, classic recipe creates a delicious breakfast treat or afternoon snack!

## Ingredients

### Wet Ingredients
- 3 ripe bananas, mashed
- ⅓ cup melted butter
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar, packed

### Dry Ingredients
- 1½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Optional Add-ins
- ½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans
- ½ cup chocolate chips
- ¼ cup dried cranberries

## Instructions

1. **Preheat** your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5 inch loaf pan.

2. **Mix wet ingredients**. In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir in the melted butter, then mix in the egg and vanilla. Add both sugars and stir until well combined.

3. **Combine dry ingredients**. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.

4. **Make the batter**. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Do not overmix. Fold in any optional add-ins you're using.

5. **Bake the bread**. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

6. **Cool completely**. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

## Tips for Success

- **Use very ripe bananas** - the spottier, the better! They should be mostly brown for the best flavor.
- **Don't overmix** the batter once you add the dry ingredients, or your bread may become dense.
- **Tent with foil** during the last 15-20 minutes of baking if the top is browning too quickly.
- **Store wrapped tightly** in plastic wrap or in an airtight container for up to 4 days at room temperature.
- **Freeze slices** individually wrapped for easy grab-and-go snacks.

## Variations

1. **Gluten-Free**: Substitute the all-purpose flour with a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend.
2. **Healthier Option**: Reduce sugar to ½ cup total and substitute ¼ cup of flour with oats.
3. **Banana Muffins**: Pour batter into a muffin tin and bake for 20-22 minutes instead.
