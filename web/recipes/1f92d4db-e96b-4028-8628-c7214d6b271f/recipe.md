# Mapo Tofu 

## Description
Mapo Tofu is a popular Sichuan dish featuring soft tofu cubes in a spicy, aromatic sauce made with minced meat, doubanjiang (fermented broad bean paste), and Sichuan peppercorns. The name comes from "Ma" (麻) meaning numbing, referring to the Sichuan peppercorns, and "Po" (婆) meaning "old woman" or "grandmother."

## Ingredients
- 1 block (400g) soft or medium-firm tofu
- 200g ground pork (or beef)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 2-3 tablespoons doubanjiang (Sichuan fermented broad bean paste)
- 1 tablespoon Sichuan chili oil (optional for extra heat)
- 1-2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns, ground
- 2 green onions, chopped (separate white and green parts)
- 1 cup chicken stock or water

### For the sauce mixture:
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce (for color)
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)

### For the slurry:
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons cold water

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the tofu**: Cut tofu into 2cm (¾ inch) cubes. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add a pinch of salt, and blanch the tofu for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.

2. **Make the sauce mixture**: In a small bowl, combine light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and Shaoxing wine. Mix well and set aside.

3. **Cook the meat**: Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground pork or beef and cook until it's no longer pink, breaking it apart with a spatula (about 3-4 minutes).

4. **Add aromatics**: Add minced garlic, ginger, and the white parts of green onions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.

5. **Add spice elements**: Add doubanjiang and stir-fry for another minute until the oil turns red. If using chili oil, add it now.

6. **Add liquid**: Pour in the chicken stock or water and bring to a boil. Add the sauce mixture and stir well.

7. **Add tofu**: Gently slide in the tofu cubes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5-8 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the tofu (avoid excessive stirring to keep tofu intact).

8. **Thicken the sauce**: Mix cornstarch and cold water to make a slurry. Gradually add to the simmering sauce while gently stirring until it reaches your desired thickness.

9. **Finish the dish**: Sprinkle with ground Sichuan peppercorns and the green parts of the green onions. Gently stir to incorporate.

10. **Serve**: Transfer to a serving dish and serve hot with steamed rice.

## Tips
- For a vegetarian version, omit the meat and use mushrooms instead, with vegetable stock.
- Adjust the amount of doubanjiang and Sichuan peppercorns according to your spice preference.
- Authentic Mapo Tofu should have a numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorns and a spicy kick from the doubanjiang.
- If you can't find doubanjiang, you can substitute with a mix of miso paste and chili sauce, though the flavor will be different.
